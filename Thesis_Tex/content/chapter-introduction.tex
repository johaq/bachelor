\section{Scope}
In 2008 Nature wrote that Google was "[g]oing from a collection of donated servers housed under a desk to a global network of dedicated data centres processing information by the petabyte" (TODO:cite) and former Google CEO Eric Schmidt said himself that "There were 5 exabytes of information created between the dawn of civilization through 2003, but that much information is now created every 2 days." Since then countless more companies are specializing in mining and more importantly analyzing large heaps of data, the phrase "Big Data" is prevalent.

\section{Focus}
The focus of this work will be to formulate a reject strategy that finds optimal thresholds regardless of the  structure of the data and classes. This strategy will be largely based on concepts introduced in the paper \cite{Fis:2015}. In order to expand on these concepts we try to find a more efficient solution by reducing the number of considered thresholds, thus leading to a faster computation time while maintaining optimality.
