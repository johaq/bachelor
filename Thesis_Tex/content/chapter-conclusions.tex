\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conc}

Coming from our goals we set in the introduction (see chapter \ref{focus}) we managed to formulate a reject strategy that expanded on paper \cite{Fis:2015} in reducing the number of thresholds that are considered in the algorithm. The results are still optimal and can be computed in quadratic running time (see chapter \ref{DPvsBF}). With the prevalence of Big Data in mind we developed a greedy approach that approximated the reject option in linear running time thus feasible for large sets of data. Our evaluation (see chapter \ref{DPvsGR}) showed that this strategy yields near optimal results on our randomly generated data sets.
